# PokemonEVTracker

Keep track of your Pokemon's EV gain with this simple app! Just click the number of EVs you're adding to a particular stat. Pokemon are saved via textfile to a folder created for you called Pokemon data. Stats cannot exceed 252 EVs individually, and 510 collectively (but if you're using this app you probably already knew that).
